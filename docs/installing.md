This should cover how to install the patched extension when you have the source. By performing these steps, you can get around the "corrupted" message.

## Steps

- Enable developer mode on your browser
- For example, go to `opera://extensions` (or wherever you can view your extensions)
- Press "Load unpacked" (or similar) and select the patched extension folder
